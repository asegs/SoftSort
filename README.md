This project was mostly a way for me to learn web server development.  
I think that with rewriting most of the Java in Go, it could be a presentable, professional application.
I do think that at some point this will be a real revolutionary concept.
That being said, some of the Java code specifically is really rough and very different from how I would write it today.
